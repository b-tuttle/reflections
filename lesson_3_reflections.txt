When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Using a remote allows you to work locally without affecting the remote until you
are ready to publish changes. This allows you to keep the commits on the remote
cleaner and more complete where they are available publicly or to collaborators.
Also, it is always nice to have your work saved to the cloud often.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

It could be confusing and difficult to have changes made by other people to the remote
automatically sync with your local work. Pushing and pulling manuallly allows you to control
your workflow and stay organized.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is a special type of clone that GitHub performs for you on their website. The
fork creates a clone of a repo on your GitHub page so that you can modify the project
without involving the original creator. A clone is used to copy a repo weither it is
local or remote. Branches are used to organize projects that may have multiple lines
of development on multiple features or maybe to maintain multiple versions.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

You can work locally without internet and still compare your branch with the
remote branch.


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

If I had to collaborate outside of GitHub I would use google drive or
dropbox for the files and use email to explain changes and make review
requests. Pretty much everything would be made easier and less error-prone
through GitHub.
