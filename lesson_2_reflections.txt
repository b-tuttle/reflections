What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When a repo is initialized Git creates the .git folder containing the
metadata required to maintain and track the repo. Without this, the
repo is just a regular directory.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area allows the user to pick and choose which files from the working
directory should be included in the repo via a commit. This is valuable
because the user can select only the needed files for a given commit to make
sure there is no clutter or unused files in the commits to the repo.
